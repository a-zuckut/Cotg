### Tampermonkey Addon

This is a script that is how I get the data to work on. Originally created by douglasg14b. Addons are nowhere near complete but include an alliance temple and military retrievers, as well as a way to limit amount of players loaded per load operation. Still need to have more to work on, but going well. 


## Project Outline

The basic outline of this project follows the format of a backend system that loads in data from csv files and updates the currently stored maps, and a more 'front-end' portion for a GUI that has quite a bit of functionality which includes just looking through alliances. 

Functions Include:
* Basic Sorting and Printing functions for alliances and players
* Computing controlled continents
* Computing shrines per continents
* Figuring shrines per alliances
* Attack Generator (only water currently)
* Water/Land castles on Continents
* Basic data structures for storing and constructing data

The GUI has a lot of these functionalities including a visualization with a scroll screen for alliances and players.

## Additional Info 

If anyone has any suggestions/remarks/bugs/etc please let me know!

Note: This project still needs to be fully documented... and tested...
